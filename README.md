Project Idea: Blockchain App for Last Will

</br>
With the increasing demand and high acceptance of people for cryptocurrencies, the inevitable questions abound, the first of which may be
What happens to my cryptocurrency after a person dies, loses his memory, or does not log in for a long time?


My Last Will App
The application applies the will of the user to his digital assets of coins and NFT
So that he can identify the heirs in proportion to each of them
In addition to the possibility of specifying the conditions that determine death, for example, not logging in for a whole year ... etc.
